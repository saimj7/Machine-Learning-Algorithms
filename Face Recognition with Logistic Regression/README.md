# Face recognition with logistic regression

Training/Testing a face recognition classifier with simple logistic regression (LR).

> We will be using a subset of 'Labeled Faces in the Wild' dataset.

## Simple Theory
- In general, LR performs classification using a sigmoid function (refer ```plots.py```). It extracts the feature vectors from an image and multiplies them with a weight vector (w) prior to passing into the sigmoid function for classification.
- You might ask how do we compute the weights? Our goal is to find the values of 'w' that make our classifier as accurate as possible; so we will need to apply gradient ascent/descent.
- Gradient is the error on the training data w.r.t the feature vectors. Based on this error, we update the 'w' with a factor called learning rate.

> We do this 'n' times in a loop or until convergence. In other words, at each subsequent loop, our algorithm moves closer and closer to the optimal 'w' values.

## Inference

- To train and test: ```python run.py```. Results:

<div align="left">
<img src=misc/result.png?raw=true "demo" width=500 >
</div>

```
[PREDICTION] predicted: George W Bush, actual: George W Bush
[PREDICTION] predicted: George W Bush, actual: George W Bush
[PREDICTION] predicted: George W Bush, actual: Donald Rumsfeld
[PREDICTION] predicted: Tony Blair, actual: Gerhard Schroeder
[PREDICTION] predicted: Tony Blair, actual: Tony Blair
```
- 83% accuracy is not too bad. Note that we have only trained on the raw pixel intensities of images.
